    "The basic idea behind the value-at-risk calculation is that we're going to look at the historical returns of a portfolio of securities and run many simulations to determine the range of returns we can expect from these.  We can then predict, over a given time horizon, what our expected loss is at a given probability, e.g., we might say that there is less than a 10% chance that the portfolio will lose more than $1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",

Do not use this code to guide actual investment decisions!\n",
